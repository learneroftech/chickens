# 🐔 Chickens Repo

Welcome to the **Chickens** repository!  

This repository is part of my hands-on practice while taking the [**Git & GitHub Bootcamp**](https://www.udemy.com/course/git-and-github-bootcamp/) by Colt Steele on Udemy.

## 📚 About This Repo

The purpose of this repo is purely educational — it's a sandbox to apply the Git and GitHub concepts taught in the course, including:

- Git initialization and tracking
- Commit history and branching
- Merging and resolving conflicts
- Working with remote repositories
- GitHub collaboration basics

## 🛠️ What's in Here?

Expect to find simple files like text files and placeholder content, all used to practice:

- `git init`, `add`, `commit`, `status`
- Branching with `git branch`, `checkout`, `merge`
- Pushing to and pulling from GitHub
- Resolving merge conflicts
- Exploring Git history with `log`, `diff`, and more

## 📦 Course Credit

This practice repo was created while learning from [Colt Steele](https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/)’s excellent Udemy course:
